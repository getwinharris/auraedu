# Deployment

- Follow the root `AGENTS.md` repository contract for deployment documentation edits.
- Keep deployment guidance aligned with PHP shared hosting, `public_html`, writable `storage/`, and Git auto-deploy.
- Treat the root `.env` as a deployable repo file for shared-hosting auto-deploy (APP_NAME and APP_URL only). Never put secrets in `.env`. Admin credentials go through Admin → Settings. API secrets (Razorpay, SMTP, Google OAuth, support bot, AI model) go through Admin → Integrations and are stored in the remote MySQL `secrets` collection — never in `.env`. Keep generated runtime secret stores, lock files, logs, and backups ignored.
- Use upstream `push` -> authenticated `repository_dispatch` -> downstream `merge-upstream` for fork synchronization. Do not use scheduled polling when event-driven dispatch is configured.
- Read production operational history from remote MySQL `audit_events` with `bapXaura logs`. Never commit hosted logs, local `server.log`, or browser-test output to Git.
- Do not introduce Node build, SPA deployment, or serverless assumptions.
- Before committing, run `bapXaura update`. Before creating or merging a PR, run non-mutating `bapXaura ci`; it validates tests, both generated maps, and `cli/smoke-local.php`.

## Hosting Infrastructure

- **Host**: Hostinger shared hosting / VPS
- **Auto-deploy**: Git push → webhook → production `git pull`
- **CI**: GitHub Actions (`bapXaura ci`) runs on push/PR to main
- **Database**: Remote MySQL (production), direct connection or `/remotedb` fallback
- **AI Model**: Configured in Admin → Integrations, stored in MySQL `secrets` table
- **Agent sub-delegation**: Sub-agents can trigger `workflow_dispatch` on GitHub Actions for long-running deployment tasks
- **Hosted tools**: plain `git` and PHP; GitHub CLI is not a Hostinger dependency

## CI/CD Pipeline

1. Developer / Agent pushes to `main`
2. GitHub Actions runs `bapXaura ci` (lint → test → map validation → smoke)
3. If passing, production webhook pulls the new code
4. Fork sync dispatches upstream-main-updated to downstream
5. Recovery: use the GitHub fork update UI or sync Action if event-driven sync fails

## Sub-Agent Cloud Delegation

Coding agents work locally and publish branches with plain Git. GitHub Actions
owns issue, handoff, PR, and review events. On hosting, agents may use project
CLI commands for database, logs, mail, and browser diagnostics, but must not
depend on `gh`.
