## 3. What Was Discussed But NOT Built

### 3.1 MCP Endpoint (`/api/mcp`)
- **Discussed but never built.** User explicitly requested MCP endpoint at `https://auraedu.co.in/api/mcp`
- Requires: JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol controller, tool definitions, resource access, prompt templates
- McpController.php was created in session but **deleted** as premature
- MCP routes were registered then **removed** from project map

### 3.2 A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol
- **Discussed but never built.** User requested A2A protocol support at `/api/mcp`
- Google's A2A standard for agent-to-agent communication
- No implementation exists

### 3.3 `/v1` Admin & Support API
- **Discussed but never built.** User requested admin and support API at `/v1`
- Separate from MCP endpoint
- No implementation exists

### 3.4 Browser Tester — CLI-Based (No Playwright Server)
- **Discussed but never built.** User wants browser-tester enhanced for CLI-based browser control
- No Playwright server-side dependency
- Browser-tester workflow exists at `.agents/workflows/browser-tester.md` but no CLI implementation
- No `bapXaura browser` command exists

### 3.5 Roo Code / External Agent MCP Support
- **Discussed but never built.** User wants external agents (Roo Code, OpenCode, etc.) to connect via MCP
- No MCP server endpoint for external agents to discover tools
- No tool definitions for external consumption

### 3.6 CDN Optimization for Docs/Blog
- **Discussed.** User reviewed CDN docs but determined no CDN needed for documentation/blog content optimization
- YAML frontmatter (`type:`) was missing in source files — this was the actual gap, not CDN
- Fixed by adding `type:` to all source files directly (not just in `.okf/` export)

### 3.7 Structural Code Graph with Resolved Edges
- **Researched but not built.** Cursor/GitCortex/Codebase-Memory use tree-sitter AST parsing to build resolved call graphs
- Capabilities: `find_callers`, `trace_path`, `blast_radius`, `detect_changes`
- Our `ProjectMapService` does route→controller→service→collection edges via regex, not full AST
- Full tree-sitter graph (like GitCortex) would require PHP FFI or a separate binary
- **Not yet implemented** — route-level edges are sufficient for current agent needs

---

## 4. What Is Implemented But NOT Documented

## 5. CLI Tool Gaps (OpenCode vs bapXaura)

### 5.1 OpenCode Has — bapXaura CLI Missing

| OpenCode Tool | bapXaura Equivalent | Status |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| `read` file | `bapXaura read file <path>` | ✅ Exists |
| `write` file | `bapXaura write file <path>` | ✅ Exists |
| `edit` file | `bapXaura edit <path> <search> <replace>` | ✅ Exists |
| `grep` | `bapXaura grep <pattern> [path]` | ✅ Exists |
| `glob` | `bapXaura find <glob>` | ✅ Partial |
| `bash` | `bapXaura run <command>` | ✅ Exists |
| `websearch` | ❌ **Not implemented** | 🚫 Missing |
| `webfetch` | ❌ **Not implemented** | 🚫 Missing |
| `task` (sub-agent dispatch) | ❌ **Not implemented** | 🚫 Missing |
| `skill` (load skills) | ❌ **Not implemented** | 🚫 Missing |
| `todowrite` (task tracking) | ❌ **Not implemented** | 🚫 Missing |
| `question` (ask user) | ❌ **Not implemented** | 🚫 Missing |

### 5.2 Playwright MCP Tools — bapXaura CLI Missing

All 17+ Playwright tools (navigate, click, snapshot, screenshot, fill, evaluate, network, type, press_key, wait_for, console, hover, select_option, file_upload, resize, drag/drop, tabs) — ❌ **None implemented**.

### 5.3 Chrome DevTools MCP Tools — All Missing

All 18+ DevTools tools (click, fill, snapshot, screenshot, evaluate, network, console, emulate, lighthouse, performance, heapsnapshot, etc.) — ❌ **None implemented**.

## 6. Research Completed (July 2026)

### 6.1 OKF v0.1 (Google Cloud, June 2026)
- **One required field**: `type` in YAML frontmatter per concept
- **Recommended**: `title`, `description`, `resource`, `tags`, `timestamp`
- **Cross-links**: standard markdown links = directed graph edges
- **Progressive disclosure**: `index.md` per directory lists contents
- **Permissive consumption**: unknown types, missing optional fields, broken links — never reject
- **Conformance**: every non-reserved `.md` has parseable YAML + non-empty `type`
- **Applied**: all 71 source `.md` files now have `type:` frontmatter; `.okf/` is a generated export

### 6.2 NotebookLM Indexing (Google Labs)
- **Source grounding**: answers restricted to uploaded sources only
- **Hybrid approach**: full-context for small documents, semantic chunking + embedding for large ones
- **Static snapshots**: files captured at upload time; no incremental re-indexing
- **Multi-angle retrieval**: generates intermediate questions, explores documents from multiple angles before synthesis
- **Relevance**: pure RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) pattern — our `.okf/` bundle serves a similar grounding role for agents

### 6.3 Cursor / GitCortex / Codebase-Memory Code Indexing
- **Merkle tree**: SHA-256 per file + directory hash for incremental change detection
- **AST chunking**: tree-sitter splits by function/class/interface (not line count)
- **Vector embeddings**: semantic similarity search (Turbopuffer/Qdrant)
- **Limitation**: no resolved edges → can't answer "what calls this?" or "what breaks?"
- **GitCortex solution**: tree-sitter → resolved call graph in KuzuDB → MCP tools (find_callers, trace_path, detect_changes, blast_radius)
- **Codebase-Memory**: 66 languages, SQLite graph, 14 MCP tools, 83% answer quality at 10× fewer tokens
- **Our approach**: `ProjectMapService::scan()` uses PHP regex for route→controller→service→collection edges; sufficient for monorepo-level understanding

## 8. Architecture Decisions (Pending)

| Decision | Options | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Who handles MCP work?** | Worker (execution), CTO (orchestration), or new role | ⏳ **Unresolved** |
| **MCP at `/api/mcp` vs separate server?** | Same PHP app vs standalone MCP server | ⏳ **Needs CEO input** |
| **A2A at same endpoint?** | `/api/mcp` serves both MCP + A2A vs separate `/api/a2a` | ⏳ **Needs CEO input** |
| **Tree-sitter PHP graph?** | PHP FFI wrapper vs separate Go/Rust binary (GitCortex) | ⏳ **Needs evaluation** |
| **Browser tester: Playwright MCP vs custom CLI?** | Use `@playwright/mcp` or build custom PHP browser control | ⏳ **Needs CEO input** |
